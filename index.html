  <header style="background-color:white;"><h1 style="font-size:20px">I'm sure you've probably played the famous game on Roblox known as Jujutsu Shenanigans. Well, this guide explains how to use the character known as Ten Shadows, or 'Megumi'.</h1></header>
  <body style="font-family:sans-serif">
    <p>First move - Rabbit Escape</p>
    <p>Rabbit escape is a medium to long-range move that is you creating a portal and throwing hundreds of rabbits at the person infront of you. Mainly a combo extender that can sometimes be used to get out of combos. Keep in mind when using rabbit escape the person you're fighting will still be able to use attacks and will just take damage. If you use Rabbit Escape and press R, it will activate a variant where a portal is created on the ground and you come out along with your rabbits, striking the foe.</p>
    <p>Second move - Nue</p>
    <p>Nue is a move that summons a bird-like Shikigami that dives down from the sky and electrifies your enemy. It knocks down your enemy and is unblockable, but can be both cancelled and very easily dodged. If you press R when Nue is coming down from the sky, you will be able to grab onto it's leg and fly for a short duration.</p>
    <p>Third move - Toad</p>
    <p>When using toad, a frog or toad (hence the name) will appear and pull your enemy towards you, stunning them and allowing you to hit them. Toad can be blocked and when done so, it will allow your enemy to hit you. If you press Toad + R, it will summon multiple Toads that grab your enemy and send them flying up into the air. In most situations, the original would be much better than the variant.</p>
    <p>Fourth move - Divine Dog: Totality</p>
    <p>Divine Dog:Totality is where you summon a black and white dog next to you. If you press 4 again, it will attack the enemy. This can be used 3 times in total before the dog disappears. The dog attack the enemy by clawing them, which can be blocked but when hit will knock down the enemy. The dog does not reach very far and will often hit about 5 studs infront of the player. This move has no variants.</p>
    <p>Special - Lurking Shadow</p>
    <p>Megumi's special is him going underground via a portal and returning out after a short duration. While you are underground a trail of black goo follows you on the surface, showing where you go.</p>
    <h1 style="font-size:50px;text-align:center;color:black;background-color:lightgray;font-family:fantasy;">Awakening</h1>
    <p>Megumi's awakening can be activated by pressing G. It is called insanity.</p>
    <p>First move - Max Elephant.</p>
    <p>Max Elephant is a move where above the player is summoned an Elephant which uses it's weight to crush the foe. You can hold this move to deal more damage, maxing out at 10 seconds. If held down for 10 seconds, it will one-shot the player infront of you. This move and all other moves onwards have no variants.</p>
    <p>Second move - Great Serpent</p>
    <p>When this move is used, the player turns into a large serpent that is constantly flying and follows the position of the user's camera. During this mode, any player that are infront of your mouth will be picked up and carried for the rest of the move's duration. When the move ends, you and all other players will come out in the Serpent's last location. This move lasts roughly 10 seconds.</p>
    <p>Third move - Shadow Swarm</p>
    <p>When used, 2 versions of the user appear next to them and you will all proceed to run together towards your camera position. If a player is infront of you while you're running, you will all proceed to beat down the foe by punching them at different times. The beatdown ends with you uppercutting the person, sending them flying back and your minions disappearing. If the move is not hit, your minions will just disappear.</p>
    <p>Fourth move - Mahoraga</p>
    <p>Mahoraga is a move that can only be used when a player is infront of you. When done so, you will crouch down with both hands stretched outwards, crossing eachother. When this happens, 3 flashes will appear. If you are not hit before then, then the Shikigami <b>Eight-Handled Sword, Divergent Sila, Divine General Mahoraga</b>(Commonly abbreviated to just Mahoraga.) Is summoned via ritual. During the ritual around the person there will appear frogs, before Mahoraga appearing in his tomb and breaking out. When fully broken out, Mahoraga will smash you to the side and you will take control of him.</p>
